# TinyAnimRuntime
A minuscule (8kb) Javascript tweening library which describes animations using an easy to read and edit JSON format. Integrates perfectly with our commercially available WYSIWYG editor [TinyAnim](http://tinyanim.com) to allow code free animating and exporting, or can be used alone by writing the JSON by hand.

##Features

- Easing options: linear, ease-in, ease-out, bounce.
- Looping options: play forever, play once, loop n times
- Parent elements to other elements to build complex hierarchies
- Variable FPS based on requestAnimationFrame with timeout based fallback
- Progress and Completion callbacks
- Commercially available WYSIWYG editor for building complex animations. Available [here](http://tinyanim.com)
